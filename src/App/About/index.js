        React Hooks? Context? Lazy? Memo? Who has time to learn about all of

        The workbook consists of a series of tasks that will get you quickly up
        to speed on the basics of some new(ish) React patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you'd prefer to do the tasks locally rather than in Code Sandbox,{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/aholachek/react-2019-interactive-workbook">
          you can clone the repo here.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started, fork this Code Sandbox, then{" "}
        <Link to="/context">just click on a task in the menu</Link> and follow
        the instructions! Each task should take between 5 and 25 minutes to
        complete. For most tasks, you'll see three cards:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A set of instructions that you can complete by checking them off.
        </li>
        <li>
          A non-working, <code>Task</code> component that you must fix by
          editing the files in the relevant folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          An <code>Expected behavior</code> example of the component in its
          final, working state
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you get confused, search for the <code>TODO</code> comments in the
        code, or (if you must) take a peek at the <code>answers</code> folder in
        each task.
